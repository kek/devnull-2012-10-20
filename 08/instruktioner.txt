Create a small graphical simulation on a 100x100 pixel canvas that works like this;

1. Each tick, create ten ‘food’  pixels randomly on the canvas.
2. Place ten grazers on the canvas. A grazer lives for 20 ticks.
3. Grazers looks for food in a 5x5 radius each tick, then moves one step toward nearest food, otherwise randomly.
4. If Grazer find food adjacent to it, it eats it (remove food)
5. If Grazer eat 5 food, create new Grazer randomly adjacent to the first. 

Add to Grazing simulation the following;

1. Add five Hunters to the simulation. A Hunter lives for 10 ticks but can move two pixels/tick.
2. A hunter looks for Grazers in a 5x5 radius each tick, then move towards the nearest one, otherwise randomly.
3. If a Hunter is adjacent to a Grazer, kill the Grazer (remove from canvas)
4. If a Hunter eat 5 Grazers, create a new Hunter randomly adjacent to the first.

Tweak parameters to get a nicer simulation. Smile. Call the judges.
